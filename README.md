# img_to_ascii
Another personal project made for fun.
Simple Image to ASCII(text) converter.
Widely known concept, implemented by me.

(
Solo tought about algorithms, and ways of dealing with pixels, arranging them into arrays,
modifying and other array calculations
NO COPY PASTE code
)


If you can still read this: implementation just started.
Fixed major bugs.
Created structre + functions.
Created classes and organized code.

This is what the main does:

# IMPORT IMAGE(CONVERTED TO GRAYSCALE)
# TRAVERSE THE IMAGE
# WRITE THE IMAGE AS A TEXT FILE
